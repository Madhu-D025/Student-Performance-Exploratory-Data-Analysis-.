# Project Title : Student-Performance-Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Objective 
This project aims to analyze key factors influencing student academic performance through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It examines socio-economic impacts, study habits, gender differences, and extracurricular activities to derive meaningful insights. Additionally, it explores predictive modeling techniques to forecast student grades based on historical data and behavioral trends.

## Dataset Details
The Student Performance Dataset contains detailed records of students' academic achievements, demographic attributes, and socio-economic factors that influence their performance. It includes key variables such as student ID, gender, age, study time, parental education level, previous academic scores, attendance, test scores, and extracurricular activities. The dataset provides insights into how various factors, including study habits, parental support, and socio-economic background, impact students' academic outcomes. By analyzing patterns in grades, attendance trends, and subject-wise performance, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key predictors of student success and potential areas for academic improvement.

## Key Features
<br>
1) Demographic Information – Includes gender, age, and parental education level, which helps analyze how background influences student performance.
<br>
2) Academic Performance – Contains subject-wise test scores, previous academic records, and overall grade percentages, allowing trend analysis of student achievements.
<br>
3) Study Habits & Learning Resources – Tracks study time, internet access, extra classes, and tutoring, providing insights into the impact of study patterns on performance.
<br>
4) Parental Influence & Support – Includes data on parental education, involvement in studies, and financial status, helping assess how family support affects student success.
<br>
5) Attendance & Behavioral Factors – Records attendance, disciplinary actions, and participation in extracurricular activities, which play a role in academic outcomes.
<br>
6) External Influences & Lifestyle Factors – Includes mental health indicators, sleep hours, social activities, and stress levels, allowing evaluation of their effect on student performance.

## Conclusion
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Student Performance provides valuable insights into the key factors affecting academic success. Gender-based performance analysis highlights that female students tend to outperform males in subjects like reading and writing, while math scores remain more balanced. Parental education and support significantly influence student achievements, with higher-educated parents correlating to better academic outcomes. The impact of study time and external factors, such as lunch type and test preparation, reveals that students with structured study habits and proper nourishment perform better. Additionally, a strong correlation exists between different subject scores, emphasizing the importance of a well-rounded academic approach. These insights can guide educators and policymakers in designing better learning environments, personalized interventions, and support systems to enhance student outcomes.
